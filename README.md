# Vandedok CayleyPy ML Tools

This package has some useful tools for making ML experiments with [CayleyPy](https://github.com/cayleypy/cayleypy/) package. It is intended for personal use, so quick fixes, weird ideas inconsistencies, lost and regnant functionality should be expected. However, feel free to check it out and use the whole or pieces of it if you feel so.

## Installation

During installation using [https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is strongly advised (though `conda` file probably be fine as well). To install the package run:

```bash
pip install cayleypy
git clone git@github.com:vandedok/vandedok_cayleypy_ml_tools.git
cd vandedok_cayleypy_ml_tools
pip install .
```
That should do the trick.

`CayleyPy` is not listed in dependencies in `pyproject.toml` as I am making changes changes there from time to time. However, I am usally keeping this package consistent with `main` branch of `CayleyPy`.
